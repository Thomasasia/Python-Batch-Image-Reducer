# Python-Batch-Image-Reducer

This program reduces a batch of images by decreasing the resolution, either to meet a max file size or to fit the images within a certain kB budget.
It does this by resizing the images, prioritizing accuracy over space and speed.
It can also access images recursively through nested folders.

Type -h or --help for a full list of arguments.
